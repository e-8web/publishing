    <h1 class="b1">How to find material on a topic you are looking for</h1>
    <p>You can start by making a list of topics that relate. Circle or highlight the topics that are most relevant. Or if you are stuck and have latitude in your research select the topics that are most intersting.</p>
    <p>Prepare to do your research. Gather materials. Look to see what you already know. This will help when you are trying to piece together what you are looking for from your research.</p>
    <p>Take a look at some way to make the information more accessible. Take a quick google search or an online source. Look in the table of contents. Speak to a librarian or someone knowledgeable about the topic. If you have time you can even make a special trip to get started such as going to the zoo to speak to a zoo employee or volunteer. </p>

    <h3>Revisite Your Topic</h3>
    <p>Revisiting your topic is important. You can ask is it broad enough? Is it overly broad? Can I get information on this topic? Will it be accessible information to me? For example if you are only able to get information in a language you do not read or understand, you might want to research another topic.</p>

    <h3>Get Backround Information</h3>
    <p>While you want to specify your topic, getting backround information can be very helpful to furthering and understanding your research. For example, if you are researching the marine mammals off the coast of California, it might be useful to get information about the ocean and sea life food chain. This also goes for your research sources find out what are reasonable sources for your project. For example the aquarium might be a good source for marine mammals off the coast of Califonria. </p>

    <h3>Find Your Sources</h3>
    <p>Finding your sources can be simple and it can be complex. The most important part is that you go out and start. Find sources that you think will be informative, if they are not you can see if they can point you in a direction that would be useful. For example books have a table of contents. People might tell you about books, other people, or organizations that might provide information. The web might have links</p>
