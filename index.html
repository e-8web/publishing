    <h1 class="b1">Research General</h1>
    <p>Say you want to do general research. First, you determine your topic. What exactly do you want to research what part?</p>
    <p>Second, you determine how you will do research. For example are you going to interview people, go to a library, or look online. </p>
    <p>Third, you will actually go to research a topic. For example say you want to learn more about making a marketin plan you can speak to someone in person, take a trip to get some books, or go online. This research can help you find out what you want to know.</p>

    <h3>Determining the Scope of Your Topic</h3>
    <p>Determining the scope of your topic is very critical to doing research. While you might have a large scope to help figure out what you want to research exactly, you want to make the bulk of your research reasonably specific and appropriate for the time you have and your purpose. For example if you want to research animals you might pick as specific animal or class of animal such as mammals. If you choose mammals you might then see what mammals have in common.</p>

    <h3>Diving Into Your Topic</h3>
    <p>What intersts You? What makes you wonder at the world? Is there a specific parameter that you need for the research you are doing for example you need to know about a certain time period or event? These questions can help you figure out what to research. Once you figure out what to research you can do a mini research where you get more information about what you want to research. This is like taking a sample. Once you take a sample you can determine if you want to look deeper in a specific are or choose another area. Say perhaps you already understand what mammals are to a level that you feel comfortable and the information on further mammal study either to in depth or to simple, you might choose to research animals by a specific geography. Additionally, you might further consider specifying marine mammals or marine mammals off the coast of California</p>
